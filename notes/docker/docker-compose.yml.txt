version: "3"

--> specify version


services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .

--> we have a service called app, and the build section of that service configuration is
    context of current directory that we're running docker compose from

    ports:
      - "8000:8000"

    --> we are mapping our app from port 8000 on our host to 8000 on our image

    volumes:
      - ./app:/app

    --> allows us to get the updates from our project, to image in real time
    --> code in our project ./app folder will be synced with /app folder on image

    command: >
      sh -c "python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000"

    > --> new line
    --> command that will run our app on image
    --> we are using shell to run the command (sh -c)

    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 --> this will run django development server available on all IP addresses (0,0,0,0) that run on docker container on port 8000
    8000 maps through ports configuration to our local machine
