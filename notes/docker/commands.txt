build docker image from Dockerfile

docker build .


build our image using docker compose configuration

docker-compose build


use docker compose to run service from docker-compose file (app service for us)

docker-compose run <service_name>

    --> anything we add after this command will be run on our docker process
    --> we can include `--rm` before service name to destroy container right away
        (will be removed on docker compose down anyways but good to know)
        for example: `docker-compose run --rm app sh -c "python manage.py startapp core"`

APP COMMANDS:

current directory: locally - ./app; docker /app --> WORKDIR


create project in current directory:
    docker-compose run app sh -c "django-admin.py startproject app ."


create core app:

  docker-compose run app sh -c "python manage.py startapp core"


migrate the database:

  docker-compose run app sh -c "python manage.py makemigrations && python manage.py migrate"


create superuser:

  docker-compose run app sh -c "python manage.py createsuperuser"


run tests:

  docker-compose run app sh -c "python manage.py test"


run tests with linting:

  docker-compose run app sh -c "python manage.py test && flake8"


run the upp:

  docker-compose up
