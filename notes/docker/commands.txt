use docker compose to run service from docker-compose file (app service for us)

docker-compose run <service_name>
                    (app)

    --> anything we add after this command will be run on our docker process
        sh -c "django-admin.py startproject app ."  --> create new project called app in our current directory

  FULL COMMAND: docker-compose run app sh -c "django-admin.py startproject app ."
